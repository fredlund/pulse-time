INSTALLATION
============

The easiest way of using the pulse_time library is by installing it as
a normal Erlang library. A good alternative is to add the directory
to the environment variable (under UNIX) ERL_LIBS. Note that this verson
of pulse_time was compiled using Erlang R16B02; you may encounter problems
running it under an earlier version of Erlang. For source code access, 
please send an email to lfredlund@fi.upm.es.

To install pulse_time in the normal Erlang directory structure
type the line

``pulse_time_install:install().''

to the Erlang shell. Erlang should be started from the same directory
as this file ("INSTALLATION"). That is,

> erl

Erlang R14B03 (erts-5.8.4) [source] [smp:2:2] [rq:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V5.8.4  (abort with ^G)
1> pulse_time_install:install().
...

You will probably have to run erlang with super-user privileges 
(under Unix/Linux) or administrator privileges (Windows) for
the installation to succeed.       

After restarting Erlang, you can verify the status of the 
pulse_time installation by typing:

> pulse_time_version:version().

in the Erlang shell.
