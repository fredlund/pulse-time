To compile the pulse_time library it normally suffices to execute 
``configure" and then ``make'' in the main directory.  In the following 
we assume that you are using a UNIX based system:

$ ./configure; make; make examples

===============================================

Installation as a normal Erlang library:

===============================================

As an alternative to including the path to the pulse_time ebin
directory in calls to erlang (e.g., erl -pa pulse_time/ebin), or
adding the pulse_time directory to the environment variable ERL_LIBS,
one can install pulse_time as a normal Erlang library. Steps:

1. Compile pulse_time as above, and then
   make release

2. Install pulse_time as a library:
   cd release/pulse_time_version*

   erl
   1> pulse_time_install:install().

For the last step to work, it may be necessary to start Erlang (erl)
with super-user rights (under Unix) or administrator rights (Windows).

More information regarding how to install pulse_time as a library,
including from a pre-compiled pulse_time distribution, can be found in
the file bininst/INSTALLATION.
